Every Indian household often has leftover medicine, some of which may still be within its expiry date while others may have expired. Usually, these leftover medicines end up in the trash, potentially harming the environment. We are proposing a software solution to address this issue. The solution involves collecting both expired and unused medicines from users, providing them with points for any medicine that is still within its expiry date. 

When a user lists their medicines, they will be put through a counterfeit checker to verify their authenticity. This involves scanning the secure QR code provided on the medicine, as per the CDSCO India regulations starting from August 1, 2023. The user will also need to enter manual data printed on the medicine, such as the company name and lot number. If the medicine's details match the company database, the medicine is deemed authentic and can be listed by the user.

After going through a user login system, the user can list the quantity of medicine they are willing to give. The data will be received by our admin portal, where we have the option to accept or reject it. We will then notify the user of the status of the pick-up.

Our model is based on research, the link to which is provided here https://www.valueinhealthjournal.com/article/S1098-3015(13)01458-7/fulltext.

The research suggests that incineration is not the best way to dispose of expired medicine, as their composition changes, rendering them ineffective. Instead, by returning these medicines to the manufacturer, the useful raw materials can be extracted and reused to produce new medicines, thus increasing supply.
